  HOW TO USE THE TOOL
============================================

Step 1: Upload an image of your graph/chart/plot

Step 2: Calibrate the axes
   - Click "Set X-min point" then click on the graph where X starts
   - Enter the real X-min value in the input box
   - Repeat for X-max, Y-min, Y-max
   - The tool needs 4 reference points to map pixels to data

Step 3: Extract data
   AUTO MODE:
   - Pick the color of the data line/points using the color picker
   - Adjust tolerance (higher = more lenient color matching)
   - Click "Extract Data"

   MANUAL MODE:
   - Switch to "Manual Click" mode
   - Click directly on data points on the graph
   - Each click adds a point

Step 4: View, edit, and export
   - Edit any X or Y value directly in the table
   - Delete individual points with the X button
   - Sort by X value
   - Export to CSV or Excel
